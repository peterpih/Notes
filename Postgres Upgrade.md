<b>To get the current database version number</b>   

$ psql   
\# SELECT version();  
<pre>
                                                    version

</pre>

<h2>Initialize new database</h2>
$ initdb /usr/local/var/postgres9.6 -E utf8
<pre>
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "peterpih".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.UTF-8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

WARNING: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

Success. You can now start the database server using:
  pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres9.6 -l logfile start

<h2>Run the Upgrade</h2>
<pre>
pg_upgrade -v \
    -d /usr/local/var/postgres \
    -D /usr/local/var/postgres9.6 \
    -b /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.4.11/bin/ \
    -B /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.6.2/bin/
    
    -d old directory   
    -D new directory   
    -b old binary/executable  
    -B new binary/executable   
</pre>

Rename the Database Directory
$ cd /usr/local/var
$ mv postgres postgres9.4  # 9.4 since that was my current version
$ mv postgres9.6 postgres  # 9.6 since that is the latest version

<b>to reverse above mv's</b>
<pre>
$ mv postgres postgres9.6  # 9.4 since that was my current version
$ mv postgres9.4 postgres  # 9.6 since that is the latest version
</pre>

<h2>Dump the database</h2>
$ <b>pg_dumpall -f</b> <em>9.4postgres.dummp</em>   
will create 9.4postgres.dump file in current directory
