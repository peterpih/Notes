5.Q What is the value of f(x)=−5I<sub>{x&gt;2}</sub>(x)+xI<sub>{x&lt;−1}</sub>(x) when x=0?
A. 0  
Reason: All indicator functions evaluate to zero.

6.Q Which of the following scenarios could we appropriately model using a Bernoulli random variable?
A. Predicting whether your hockey team wins its next game (tie counts as a loss)   
Reason:  Remember that a Bernoulli random variable is for just one trial.

7.Q Calculate the expected value of the following random variable: X takes on values {0,1,2,3} with corresponding probabilities {0.5,0.2,0.2,0.1}. Round your answer to one decimal place.

A. 0.9  
This is 0(.5)+1(.2)+2(.2)+3(.1).

8.Q Which of the following scenarios could we appropriately model using a binomial random variable (with n > 1)?

A. Predicting the number of wins in a series of three games against a single opponent (ties count as losses)  
Reason: The binomial model assumes a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.

9.Q. Suppose X∼Binomial(3,0.2). Calculate P(X=0). Round your answer to two decimal places.

A. Evaluate the probability mass function for a binomial, 

P(X=x)=(<sup>n</sup><sub>x</sub>)p<sup>x</sup> (1−p)<sup>(n−x)</sup>, with n=3, p=0.2 and x=0.

10.Q Suppose X∼Binomial(3,0.2). Calculate P(X≤2). Round your answer to two decimal places.

A. Evaluate the probability mass function of the binomial for the relevant values of X and add their probabilities.
