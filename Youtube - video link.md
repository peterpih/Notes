- **controls=** … 1 turns on the controls (like play/pause and the time bar), 0 turns them off.  Useful if you don’t want them to be able to scan through.  Force them to watch your whole little bikini dance. They’ll still have access to play and pause by clicking the video itself.

- **showinfo=** …Set this to 0 to turn off the sharing and info features.  1 turns them on.

- **autoplay=**… Set this to 1 to have the video autoplay when they get to the page. 0 means they have to click play.

- **rel=** … Set this to 0 to not include related videos after the current one plays.  1 will give related videos.
