<b>utm_content</b>:   Used to differentiate similar content, or links within the same ad. For example, 
               if you have two call-to-action links within the same email message, you can use 
               <b>utm_content</b> and set different values for each so you can tell which version is 
               more effective.
               
               You can use Campaign Content to indicate the specific ad, button, or link that was 
               clicked
